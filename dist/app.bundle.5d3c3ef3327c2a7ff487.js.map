This approach allows usage\n\t * of angular filters as well as custom logic inside your translated messages without unnecessary impact on translations.\n\t *\n\t * So for example when you have message like this:\n\t * ```js\n\t * <div translate>Last modified {{modificationDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'}} by {{author}}.</div>\n\t * ```\n\t * you will have it extracted in exact same version so it would look like this:\n\t * `Last modified {{modificationDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'}} by {{author}}`.\n\t * To start with it might be too complicated to read and handle by non technical translator. It's easy to make mistake\n\t * when copying format for example. Secondly if you decide to change format by some point of the project translation will broke\n\t * as it won't be the same string anymore.\n\t *\n\t * Instead your translator should only be concerned to place {{modificationDate}} correctly and you should have a free hand\n\t * to modify implementation details on how to present the results. This is how you can achieve the goal:\n\t * ```js\n\t * <div translate translate-params-modification-date=\"modificationDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'\">Last modified {{modificationDate}} by {{author}}.</div>\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * There's a few more things worth to point out:\n\t * 1. You can use as many parameters as you want. Each parameter begins with `translate-params-` followed by snake-case parameter name.\n\t * Each parameter will be available for interpolation in camelCase manner (just like angular directive works by default).\n\t * ```js\n\t * <div translate translate-params-my-custom-param=\"param1\" translate-params-name=\"name\">Param {{myCustomParam}} has been changed by {{name}}.</div>\n\t * ```\n\t * 2. You can rename your variables from current scope to simple ones if you like.\n\t * ```js\n\t * <div translate translate-params-date=\"veryUnintuitiveNameForDate\">Today's date is: {{date}}.</div>\n\t * ```\n\t * 3. You can use translate-params only for some interpolations. Rest would be treated as usual.\n\t * ```js\n\t * <div translate translate-params-cost=\"cost | currency\">This product: {{product}} costs {{cost}}.</div>\n\t * ```\n\t

This approach allows usage\n * of angular filters as well as custom logic inside your translated messages without unnecessary impact on translations.\n *\n * So for example when you have message like this:\n * ```js\n * <div translate>Last modified {{modificationDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'}} by {{author}}.</div>\n * ```\n * you will have it extracted in exact same version so it would look like this:\n * `Last modified {{modificationDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'}} by {{author}}`.\n * To start with it might be too complicated to read and handle by non technical translator. It's easy to make mistake\n * when copying format for example. Secondly if you decide to change format by some point of the project translation will broke\n * as it won't be the same string anymore.\n *\n * Instead your translator should only be concerned to place {{modificationDate}} correctly and you should have a free hand\n * to modify implementation details on how to present the results. This is how you can achieve the goal:\n * ```js\n * <div translate translate-params-modification-date=\"modificationDate | date:'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss Z'\">Last modified {{modificationDate}} by {{author}}.</div>\n * ```\n *\n * There's a few more things worth to point out:\n * 1. You can use as many parameters as you want. Each parameter begins with `translate-params-` followed by snake-case parameter name.\n * Each parameter will be available for interpolation in camelCase manner (just like angular directive works by default).\n * ```js\n * <div translate translate-params-my-custom-param=\"param1\" translate-params-name=\"name\">Param {{myCustomParam}} has been changed by {{name}}.</div>\n * ```\n * 2. You can rename your variables from current scope to simple ones if you like.\n * ```js\n * <div translate translate-params-date=\"veryUnintuitiveNameForDate\">Today's date is: {{date}}.</div>\n * ```\n * 3. You can use translate-params only for some interpolations. Rest would be treated as usual.\n * ```js\n * <div translate translate-params-cost=\"cost | currency\">This product: {{product}} costs {{cost}}.</div>\n * ```\n
