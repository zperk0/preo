			<p>The PreoDay pre-order app helps improve your customers' experience. By removing from the point of service, two of the most time-consuming elements (customer decision making and payment process), the pre-order app helps streamline order flow. In their own time and from any location, customers can make their choices on their mobile phone and pay for them in advance, for later collection from you or for delivery to a designated location.</p>
